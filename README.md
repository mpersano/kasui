## Kasui

This is the source for Kasui, a kanji puzzle game for Android (without the Android-specific code
and things like sprite-packing tools, and with lower-resolution graphics). This version should
work on Linux.

Please don't judge the quality of this code, I'm aware it's quite awful (I wrote it quite a while
ago). I'm placing it here to motivate me to clean it enough to work on a new version (I have a few
ideas for new features but at the moment changing anything is quite painful).

Props to [sumitani](https://github.com/sumitani) who did the beautiful graphics and contributed with lots of ideas.
